Simple path planning algorithm implemented on C# and visualized on Unity.
The UAV positions are deducted using the Dijkstra and Dual Ascent algorithms, which were provided by Andrea and Alessio.

All control algorithm related scripts are located in Assets/Scripts/Coverage.
All others are essential for the smooth operation of Unity. Visualization is mainly achieved through MapGenerator located in Assets/Scripts/Coverage/MapGenerator.
